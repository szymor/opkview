=== Tiny OPK Viewer ===

A simple tool for viewing OpenDingux and RetroFW packages. It supports opening OPKs from both CLI and GUI.

=== to do list ===
- support for multiple open files (multitab view, cmdline)
- image viewer navigation in case of multiple images in the root directory
- avoid duplication of content of manual files (and possibly other files) via a reference to another section in the OPK description
- windows port
- maybe C++ port
- maybe more information about ELF files
